Domo Arigato, Mr. Roboto!

### What is this thing?

This is an example of a "Toy Robot Simulator". It reads instruction files to direct the robot around a table of MxN dimensions, and can report the location of the robot at any time. *AMAZING!*

### Why are you doing this?

I'd like the opportunity to get hired at Locomote.
